Waiting on more projects to start at work and most of my coding in bootcamp was in Ruby. 

I'm going through this course from Stack Skills that I bought for like $30 to make sure I didn't miss anything fundamental about JS and jQuery as well as vanilla responsive design.

**I know these are basic lessons with some _nasty_ inline JS with HTML, but I find it valuable to see how tasks were accomplished outside of a framework whether that was Ruby on Rails, or Handlebars, etc; it's always good to understand the basics and understand _why_ or _what_ motivated a person or people to find a better way.**
